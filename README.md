I've learned a lot about how to write an RESTful API using Golang but never had the chance to put it into practice so I've decided to write a course management system.

Inspiration came from one of the student clubs I attend in my university. The club is related to music and they offer instrument courses. Courses are amazing overall but there's a small problem, the way course content is shared. 

Course content is often shared via WhatsApp group which consists of participants of the course. However sometimes videos, practice materials, music sheets get lost in messages or you have to scroll a lot to find an old material. This simple course management system will solve this problem.

I didn't devise all the project yet, so stay in tune!
